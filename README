All of the files are here. I have been using MAMP for testing due to the ajax pulling. I got wierd results when I just used the browser and the filesystem.

I have marked the drawing code where the ball is and I have marked where the drawing code for the blocks are. But in case the code
is hard to plug through here are the line numbers:


+ drawing the wall in the level object:
  line number: 214

+ where the player gets drawn in the node object:
  line number: 196
